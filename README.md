# InfoUser
A PowerShell script used to learn PowerShell GUI creation with WPF.

The Interface was created in VisualStudio. Like every learner, It was made from parts of scripts that I've found over the net and adapted them to my desire. I'm not proud of some parts of the code, but they do there works.
It is also a way to showcase my ability with PowerShell.
